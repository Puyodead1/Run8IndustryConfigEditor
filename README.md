# Run8IndustryConfigEditor
Windows desktop application for viewing and modifying Run8 Train Simulator V3 Industry Configuration files (.ind).<br>

This is a work in progress, along with other Run8 modding tools.


You can find development builds in [GitHub Actions](/actions).
Slim builds are just the application without .NET, Full builds include everything


If you are a developer, I have published some File Format information for Run8 V3 [here](https://github.com/Puyodead1/Run8-V3-reverse-engineering).
