# Run8IndustryConfigEditor
Windows desktop application for viewing and modifying Run8 Train Simulator V3 Industry Configuration files (.ind).<br>

This is a work in progress, along with other Run8 modding tools.
<br>
<br>

You can find builds in the [releases](https://github.com/Puyodead1/Run8IndustryConfigEditor/releases/latest).

Slim builds are just the application without .NET, Full builds include everything
<br>
<br>

If you are a developer, I have published some File Format information for Run8 V3 [here](https://github.com/Puyodead1/Run8-V3-reverse-engineering).
